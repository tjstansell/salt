ISSUE #16564 [OPEN]: (jacksontj) Reactor is VERY PID hungry [Feature], [Pending Discussion]
PR #18254 [CLOSED]: (jacksontj) Move reactor master-clients to threads 
* 82ac851 Merge pull request #18254 from jacksontj/2014.7
  * c93ca9a Pylint cleanup for threadpool
  * 22ed101 Remove some un-used variables
  * 0b19ec7 Remove "fire_event" from AsyncClientMixin, since this was only added to remove infinite recusion in the reactor-- which is now not calling this API
  * 2a8d2a4 Historically the recator has just called the "async" method of the runner and wheel clients, but this actually creates daemonized processes. In addition to creating a new daemonized process each event, the number of process it creates is unbounded, meaning that the reactor can easily use all available PIDs on a fairly busy master. In addition, there is no bound on the CPU that these are allowed to use (since they can create ALL the pids). This changes the reactor to create a threadpool for executing its master-side clients (runner/wheel). This threadpool has a configurable number of workers (max parallelism) and hwm (max queue size before dropping events).
